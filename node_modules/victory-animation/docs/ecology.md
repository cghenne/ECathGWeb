VictoryAnimation
================

VictoryAnimation animates prop changes for any [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) component. Just use a child function inside VictoryAnimation that accepts an object of tweened values and returns a component to render.

## Features

### Animation Queue

When given an array of values, VictoryAnimation will use it as an animation queue.

```playground
<VictoryAnimation data={[
  { color: "red" },
  { color: "green" },
  { color: "blue" },
  { color: "yellow" },
  { color: "purple" }
]} delay={3000}>
  {(style) =>
    <span style={style}>Hello!</span>
  }
</VictoryAnimation>
```

### Animate Any Component

Anything can be animated! Your function can return any React component, and itâ€™s up to you to decide how to use the latest tweened values. A common pattern is to pass them all down to your component as props.

```playground
<svg onClick={() => {
  const state = this.state || {};
  this.setState({ x: state.x ? 0 : 100 });
}}>
  <VictoryAnimation data={
    this.state || { x: 0 }
  }>
    {(props) => (
      <text { ...props } y={50}>
        Click me!
      </text>
    )}
  </VictoryAnimation>
</svg>
```
